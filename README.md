# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

 
 
 ## Description
This webpage acts as a web portfolio for all the work done in the Coding Bootcamp. At the end of this course, this page will function as a full portfolio of all the web development work I have done, which will be useful to show employers. 

In this webpage, there are several different CSS variables and other aspects of CSS that prove I am able to use CSS effectively. There are some links to things such as my email and Github, and a bit of information about me.

 ## Usage
This web page is deployed to the web through Github Pages. To use it, visit the link and from there, it's easy to click on the various projects I've completed through the links in the 'work' section. 

 ## Demo
The first page of this portfolio as seen below shows a bit about me, along with a photo. At the top of the navigation bar, there are clickable links to the different sections of this page. When clicked, these links will take you to the corresponding section of the portfolio. There is also a Resume button which currently just links to a LinkedIn login page as my LinkedIn is not up to date.
