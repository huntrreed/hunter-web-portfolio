# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## What's This?

Hello! This webpage acts as a web portfolio for all the work done in the Coding Bootcamp. Currently, there is just one other completed project, but as I go - there will be more projects I can add to my page! At the end of this course, this page will function as a full portfolio that I can use for employers. 

In this webpage, there are several different CSS variables and other aspects of CSS.
